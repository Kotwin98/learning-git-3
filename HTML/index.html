            <p class="lyrics">Is this the real life?<br/> 
            Is this just fantasy?<br/> 
            Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.<br/> 
            Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.<br/> 
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br/> 
            Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.<br/>
            Anyway the wind blows<br/> 
            Doesn't really matter to me, to me.</p>
