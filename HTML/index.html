            <p class="lyrics">
                Is this the real life?<br/> 
                Is this just fantasy?<br/> 
                Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.<br/> 
                Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.<br/> 
                I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br/> 
                Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.<br/>
                Anyway the wind blows<br/> 
                Doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br/>
            </p>
            <p class="lyrics">
                Mama just killed a man<br/>
                Put a gun against his head<br/> 
                Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.<br/> 
                Mama, life had just begun<br/>
                But now I've gone and thrown it all away.<br/> 
                Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry,<br/> 
                If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,<br/> 
                Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.
            <p/>
            <p class="lyrics">
                Too late, my time has come<br/>
                Sends shivers down my spine<br/>
                Body's aching all the time.<br/> 
                Good bye, everybody, I've got to go<br/>
                Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.<br/>
